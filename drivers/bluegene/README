Bluegene NIC driver
===================

These files contain the source code to a device driver which makes
BlueGene's tree device accessible as a standard network interface
card.  The device name is bgnic with a mac address which is composed
of the Bluegene node ID plus a fixed constant (0xab000000 + node id).

The driver supports broadcast and point-to-point messages.  IP address
propagation is performed through ARP.  The easiest method is to
configure the node with an IP address at startup time.  We extended
/etc/rc.d/rc.network with the following lines:

BGNIC_IP=`echo 0x$BG_UCI | awk '{printf "192.168.%d.%d", $1 / 0x10000 % 0x100, $1 / 0x100 % 0x100}'`
BGNIC_NM=255.255.0.0
BGNIC_GW=192.168.2.0
ifconfig eth0 $BGNIC_IP netmask $BGNIC_NM

This version of the driver has a very small MTU size of 240 bytes.  In
the next version we will support packet fragmentation with an MTU size
of up to 64kB.

Maintainers
===========

The driver was developed as part of the Kittyhawk project by:
- Volkmar Uhlig (vuhlig@us.ibm.com)
- Jonathan Appavoo (jappavoo@us.ibm.com)
- Amos Waterland (awaterl@us.ibm.com)

Revision History
================

Version 0.1: Initial release.  Basic support for BG's tree network
  with max MTU size of 240 bytes.

Version 0.2: Separation of tree and NIC driver.  The tree solely acts
  as a transport layer while the NIC is encapsulated on top.  The NIC
  is presented as a standard ethernet device.  The tree supports
  fragmentation of up to 256 fragments of 240 bytes each.
